            <h2>General questions</h2>
            <h5><i>Q: What is Prepaway.com?</i></h5>
            <p><b>A:</b> Prepaway is a community of IT certification exam takers committed to sharing their exam knowledge and experience with their peers, as well as those looking for free information sources to study for their IT exams. Our members share their knowledge on IT certification exams in convenient ETE files.</p>
            <p>Please note that Prepaway is basically an information sharing platform: we do not sell software, neither do we support or troubleshoot it (keep reading to find out where you can get your ETE software). All we do is let people share their ETE uploads, download files and post their feedback.</p>
            <h2>How to open ETE files</h2>
            <h5><i>Q: What exactly are ETE files?</i></h5>
            <p><b>A:</b> ETE (Exam Testing Engine) is a file format that realistically simulates IT exam environment, allowing for the most convenient exam preparation you can get - in the convenience of your own home or on the go. If you have ever seen IT exam simulations, chances are, they were in the ETE format. For details on how to create, use and convert ETE files, please refer to the separate section below.</p>
            <h5><i>Q: Who can upload the files?</i></h5>
            <p><b>A:</b> All files are uploaded by Prepaway community members. We encourage everyone who has recently taken an exam and/or has come across some braindumps that have turned out to be true to share this information with the community by creating and uploading ETE files.</p>
            <h5><i>Q: Who can download the files?</i></h5>
            <p><b>A:</b> The files may be downloaded by individuals for their personal use - exam preparation. This means that downloading files for commercial use/reselling is not permitted. Prepaway reserves the right to block users suspected of reselling the files at our sole discretion.</p>
            <h5><i>Q: How many files can I upload/download per day?</i></h5>
            <p><b>A:</b> You can upload an unlimited number of ETE files. Downloading is restricted to maximum 15 files per day. The limit was imposed with the goal to prevent commercial use of ETE files created by our members.</p>
