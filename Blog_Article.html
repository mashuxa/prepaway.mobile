                        <h2>Certified in Risk and Information System Control (CRISC) – $131, 298</h2>
                        <p>The Certified in Risk and Information System Control certification is developed for project managers, IT professionals, and others whose job portfolio include identifying and managing business and IT risks through apt Information Systems Controls. The CRISC certification is offered by ISACA and was introduced in year 2010. The certification covers the whole life cycle from development to execution to continuous maintenance.</p> <img src="design/img/content/post-preview-img/Untitled-2.png">
                        <p>Competitive Edge: over twenty thousand individuals have earned this certification all over the world. About 96% of these people have current renewal of the certification. As of today, the CRISC certification is the highest paying credential in 2018. This is because of the high demand for experts with these skills and the fairly undersized supply of those who possess them. To earn a CRISC certification, you must have a minimum of 3 years’ experience in two of the four specifications that the certification covers. </p>
                        <p>The individual seeking to earn this certification must also pass the examination. The examination is offered during three 8-week windows in a year. For the year 2018, the exam periods are 1st May – 30th June, 1st August – 30th September, and 1st November – 31st December. It is important to mention that the examination is computer based. In addition to this, it must be noted that CPE, (Continuing Professional Education) credits are needed every year to maintain the certification. Earning a certification in CRISC requires continuous efforts and years of strategic planning. It is envisaged that this certification will continue to be in high demand for many years to come, especially with the expansion of cloud computing.</p>
